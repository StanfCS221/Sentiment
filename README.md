Tests and solutions for Stanford's CS221 class. My part of code is in 'submission.py' file between 'BEGIN_YOUR_CODE' and 'END_YOUR_CODE'. Tests can be executed by running 'grader.py' file. More information about the assignment can be found by opening 'index.html' file. Solutions to the written part of the assignments are not published but I am happy to discuss them in person. Making a film-review classifier using Machine Learning. This specific repo is focused on ML and K-means. Using ML to determine whether a film-review is positive or negative. Learning weights on a given dataset. Implementing a feature extractor which extract features from paragraphs of text. Showing different results for features being space delimited words, and just strings of a given length. To my surprise, strings of given length tend to give comparable or even better results than using words as features. Using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the hinge loss. Implementing basic K-means Clustering algorithm.
